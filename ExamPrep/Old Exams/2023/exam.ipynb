    "\"Friends\" is an American television sitcom that originally aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004. Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, the show gained immense popularity and has since become a classic in the world of television. The series is set in New York City and revolves around a group of six friends: Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). The show explores their personal and professional lives as they navigate the ups and downs of relationships, careers, and the challenges of adulthood.\n",

    "In this exam, we will use a dataset containing all the conversations that occurred over 10 seasons of Friends. We refer to each row in the dataset as an 'utterance.\" The data format of the dataset is as follows\n",

    "- id: `<str>`, the index of the utterance in the format sAA_eBB_cCC_uDDD, where AA is the season number, BB is the episode number, CC is the scene/conversation number, and DDD is the number of the utterance in the scene (e.g. s01_e18_c05_u021).\n",
    "- speaker: `<str>`, the speaker who made the utterance, e.g. Monica Geller\n",
    "- conversation_id: `<str>`, the id of the first utterance in the conversation this utterance belongs. We assume conversations begin at the start of a new scene.\n",
    "- reply_to: `<str>`, the id of the utterance to which this utterance replies. None if the utterance is the first in a conversation.\n",
    "- text: `<str>`, the textual content of the utterance.\n"
